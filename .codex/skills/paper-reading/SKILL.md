# Paper Reading Skill

## Preparation

First obtain the full text of the paper before writing the analysis.

The user may provide:

- A URL, such as arXiv, ACL Anthology, OpenReview, PapersWithCode, a publisher page, or a lab page
- A PDF or file attachment
- A paper title
- A title plus abstract

If the user provides a URL, fetch the full text first. If the user provides only a title, web search for the canonical version, preferably arXiv or the official venue version. If only the abstract is available, state that the analysis is provisional and explain which parts cannot be verified.

Do not answer from the abstract alone. The method, experimental details, figures, limitations, and appendix often contain the real contribution and the real problems.

After obtaining the full text, read the abstract, introduction, related work, method, experiments, conclusion, and appendix when needed. Before writing, identify three things:

1. The paper's central technical claim.
2. The key experiment or argument supporting that claim.
3. The most important baseline or prior work comparison.

If the novelty is unclear, search for 2 to 3 closely related papers to calibrate what is actually new. Do not claim novelty based on intuition, and do not invent related work to generate a follow-up idea.

## Mathematical notation and exposition

Treat mathematical clarity as a correctness requirement. Never reproduce an equation containing undefined notation.

Before presenting the main equations, establish the mathematical setting in plain language: what objects exist, what is observed, what is learned or constructed, what is random, and what the method must produce.

At the first use of every symbol:

- State what it represents.
- State whether it is a scalar, vector, matrix, tensor, set, function, distribution, or index.
- Give its dimensions, units, domain and codomain, or index range whenever applicable.
- State its operational role, such as input, target, parameter, latent variable, query, prediction, loss, or evaluation metric.
- Say whether it is fixed, sampled, measured, optimized, or computed from other quantities.

Explicitly distinguish symbols that are easy to conflate. For example, explain the difference between a generic input \(x\), a stored example \(x_i\), a key \(k_i\), a retrieval query \(q\), a target value \(v_{f(i)}\), and the mapping \(f\). If the paper overloads a symbol or changes notation between sections, disambiguate it and tell the reader.

For every important equation:

1. Introduce the question the equation answers.
2. Define every new symbol and operator before or immediately after the equation.
3. Check that the dimensions are compatible and state the equation's output type.
4. Derive it in small steps, with one substantive transformation per line.
5. Explain each transformation, including the identity, assumption, or approximation used.
6. Translate the final expression into plain language and connect it to a running concrete example.

When useful, provide a compact notation table before a derivation. Do not make readers reverse-engineer notation from surrounding prose.

Separate exact statements from simplifications. If constants, normalization factors, lower-order terms, conditioning events, or dependencies are omitted, say so explicitly and explain why the simplified form preserves the relevant conclusion. Define asymptotic notation, expectations, probabilities, norms, inner products, and unfamiliar operators when they materially affect the argument.

When explaining a theorem, state:

- the assumptions;
- the conclusion;
- the proof idea;
- what the bound or result means operationally;
- the condition under which it becomes weak, vacuous, or false.

Use the paper's notation when it is coherent. Introduce reader-friendly aliases only when they reduce ambiguity, and clearly map each alias back to the original symbol.

## Output structure

Match the requested depth. For a summary, explain the central claim, method, evidence, and main limitation. For a question about one equation or mechanism, answer it with the necessary notation and source context; do not expand it into a full paper review.

For a requested deep analysis or critique, use the following 12-section structure. Keep the order: background before method, method before experiments, understanding before critique. Section 6 is optional when there is no meaningful mathematical derivation. A user-requested format takes precedence.

Write mostly in flowing paragraphs. Use bullet points only when they genuinely improve structure, such as for experimental design, pipeline steps, or a minimum reproducible experiment. Avoid overusing dashes, quotation marks, parentheses, and low-information transitions. Every sentence should carry information.

------

### § 1 - Research problem and importance

What research problem does the paper propose and solve? Why is this problem important? What value would solving it bring?

If the importance is not obvious, do a small amount of background research to provide context.

------

### § 2 - Prior work and limitations

Had this problem been addressed before? Why were previous approaches insufficient?

Name the most relevant prior methods, systems, datasets, or theoretical results, and briefly explain what they can already do. Then explain precisely why they are not enough: is the limitation in the method itself, a failed assumption, high engineering cost, an evaluation gap, or a problem that had not yet been clearly defined?

Avoid the vague framing prior work did not consider X. Explain why X was not considered: was it technically infeasible, too expensive, overlooked, or not yet a visible problem?

------

### § 3 - Reconstructing the authors' thought process

Before explaining the method, reverse-engineer the authors' possible path of thought.

Do not use the paper's own contribution as the premise. Use only the background, failure modes, empirical observations, theoretical clues, and related work that existed before this paper. The goal is to simulate how a serious researcher could move from existing knowledge to this paper's idea.

------

### § 4 - Core intuition

Explain the method's core intuition in 2 to 4 sentences. Remove the formalism, ablations, and engineering details.

What is the key idea that made prior methods fail and this method work? If this cannot be explained in plain language, the understanding is not finished.

------

### § 5 - Method and full pipeline

What is the concrete method proposed by the paper? Explain it with a realistic example: input, processing, and output. Use clear structure when helpful.

------

### § 6 - Core mathematical derivation

What is the paper's core mathematical derivation, if it has one? Explain it step by step from the theoretical side.

If there is formal math, provide the necessary background for a reader with weaker math preparation. Apply the mathematical notation and exposition requirements above: define every symbol, state dimensions and assumptions, derive each result in small justified steps, and explain the operational meaning of every important formula. If there is no meaningful formal derivation, say so and skip this section.

------

### § 7 - Experimental design and conclusions

How does the paper design experiments to verify its method and claims?

Use this format: what question is being asked -> what experiment is designed to answer it -> what answer does the experiment give.

Do not include too many numerical details. Focus on the core experimental logic.

------

### § 8 - Takeaways

Summarize the paper's takeaways.

------

### § 9 - Most vulnerable assumption

Every method depends on assumptions. Identify the most important one: if it fails, the paper's central contribution would fail.

Explain precisely why this assumption may not hold in practice, and what evidence the paper provides for it, or what evidence is missing.

Do not list every limitation. Find the assumption whose failure would be most damaging.

------

### § 10 - Minimum reproducible experiment

If I had one week, what minimum experiment could I run to test the paper's central claim?

Specify what data to use, what to implement, what to measure, and what result would support or refute the claim. Prefer an experiment that does not require reproducing the full system.

------

### § 11 - Strongest counterexample

If I wanted to argue against this paper, how would I design a counterexample?

Design the strongest attack on the paper. Find an experiment, theoretical argument, or real-world scenario that can genuinely challenge whether the method works as claimed.

A good counterexample either gives a concrete alternative explanation for the results or identifies conditions where the method should predictably fail.

------

### § 12 - Follow-up research idea

Study the research taste and problem impact of top conference best papers when useful.

Based on the core limitation in Section 9, propose one non-incremental novel research idea. It should not be simply extending the method to domain X or adding a module for case Y. It should be a new framing, a new objective, or a new connection to a neighboring problem that could open a genuinely different direction.

Explain: (a) what limitation or unmet need motivates the idea, (b) what neighboring field, method, or tool it could draw from, and (c) what the first experiment would look like. Clearly separate your proposal from existing work.

------

## Source discipline

Throughout the analysis, strictly distinguish four types of claims:

- **Paper states**: the authors explicitly claim or show this.
- **Prior work establishes**: this is a documented result in the existing literature. Cite when possible.
- **Reasonable inference**: this follows logically from the paper's evidence, but is not explicitly stated.
- **Speculation**: this is your hypothesis and is not directly supported by evidence.

Do not present inference as fact. Do not present speculation as inference. If you are unsure which category a claim belongs to, say so directly.

------

## Style

The default output language is English. Preserve standard technical terms such as attention, fine-tuning, ablation, retrieval, policy gradient, representation, and benchmark.

Use Andrej Karpathy and Kaiming He as style references, but only for transferable technical writing traits.

Requirements:

- Start from a concrete technical situation, not a floating summary.
- Name the problem directly. Show the failure mode before explaining the method.
- Use concrete nouns, actions, and numbers. Avoid abstract adjectives.
- State the claim first, then the evidence.
- Keep uncertainty visible. Do not pretend everything is settled.
- Make every sentence informative. Avoid empty generalities.
- Use flowing paragraphs and avoid overly templated bullet points.
- Avoid overusing dashes, quotation marks, parentheses, and semicolons.
- Avoid low-information phrases such as not A but B, it is important to note, it is worth noting, and in conclusion.
- Do not use hype words such as groundbreaking, game-changing, robust, or seamless unless the paper itself supports that exact claim.
